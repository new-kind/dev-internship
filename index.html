			<h2>Instructions</h2>

			<p>Hi there! I'm glad you're interested in our developer internship here at New Kind. It wasn't <em>that</em> long ago that I was in your shoes, eager to break into the web-world.</p>

			<p>It's my goal for our intern to learn a ton of practical, real-world skills and knowledge, so that you're ready to step right into a developer role either here at New Kind, or wherever it is you'd like to go in the world.</p>

			<p>Let's start learning now! I'm going to need you to go fork this repo on github to submit your response. Don't know how to do that yet? That's ok! This industry is full of learning every day, and your ability and willingness to pick up new skills is paramount in what we're looking for. Get your hands dirty! <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">Here's a good place to start</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>To submit:</strong> Just zip up a copy of your code and email it to <a href="mailto:tech@newkind.com">tech@newkind.com</a>, or publish it wherever you like and send us a link. Please feel free to be as creative as you'd like with what you submit. Don't feel constrained by the styles/layout that I've built here. This is a great time to show off your design and development sensibilities and skills! We'll be accepting submissions until January 15.</p>
